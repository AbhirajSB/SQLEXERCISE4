--Project: Design a store database
--Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes,
--whatever you want your store to specialize in. You should have a table for all the items in your store,
--and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. You should sell at least 15 items,
--and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.
